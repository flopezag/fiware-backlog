This is the sphinx project to generate the Documentation guide for the Backlog
tool using sphinx. The content was initially develop by Manuel Escriche and
currently is maintained by me.

## Description of the content

The content is divided into 2 subfolders

- source: it contains the .rst, templates and images files to compile the document
using sphinx
- build: it contains the different complied versions of the documentation. It is not
upload to the github but it is created with the first compilation of the content.

## Build and Install

### Requirements

The following software must be installed:

- Python 2.7
- pip
- virtualenv


### Installation

The recommend installation method is using a virtualenv. Actually, the installation 
process is only about the python dependencies, because the python code do not need 
installation.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create virtualenv: 'virtualenv -p python2.7 env
3. Activate the virtualenv: 'source env/bin/activate
4. Install dependencies: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

### Configuration

There is a directory 'site_config' that contains all the configurations files that
are needed to execute the scripts. It contains sensible information and it is not
upload to the github repository. Please contact with the owner of the repository
if you want to use it.

By default, we provide you the configuration files autogenerated by sphinx, but if
you want to generate them again, we give you details about the different steps that
you should follow. The files involved in the configuration are:

- Makefile and make.bat
- /source/conf.py which is generated by sphinx configuration program
- /source/index.rst which is the starting point and it is also generated by sphinx

In order to generate them, just execute:

    $ sphinx-quickstart
    
You will see something like the following, please answer the questions:

    > Root path for the documentation [.]: 
    > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y
    > Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: _
    > Project name: FIWARE Backlog Management
    > Author name(s): Fernando LÃ³pez
    > Project version []: 1.0
    > Project release [1.0]: 1.0.0
    > Project language [en]: en

    > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: y
    > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: y
    > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: y
    > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: y
    > imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: y
    > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: n
    > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: y
    > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: y
    > githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]: y
    > Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: y
    > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: y

Important things here, do not forget to add autodoc option. Now you have installed and configured
the content to generate the proper documentation.

Last but not least, the theme that I am using for HTML and HTML Help pages is 'sphinxdoc' by default
sphinx assign you the theme 'alabaster'. You can change it in the following line in the source/conf.py:

    # -- Options for HTML output ----------------------------------------------
    
    # The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
    # a list of builtin themes.
    #
    html_theme = 'sphinxdoc'

## Compilation

To compile the content with sphinx you have to options:

- Use the sphinx commands to execute it:

    $ sphinx-build -b html <sourcedir> <builddir>/html

where <sourcedir> and <builddir> are the source and build directory respectively. 
It generates the html content on that directory.
  
- Use the Makefile autogenerated with sphinx:
    
    $ make html
    
There are other options to generate the content, take a look in
sphinx documentation or just execute:

    $ make
    
It shows you the list of available options:

    Sphinx v1.5.2
    Please use `make target' where target is one of
      html        to make standalone HTML files
      dirhtml     to make HTML files named index.html in directories

      htmlhelp    to make HTML files and an HTML help project
      qthelp      to make HTML files and a qthelp project
      devhelp     to make HTML files and a Devhelp project
      epub        to make an epub
      latex       to make LaTeX files, you can set PAPER=a4 or PAPER=letter
      latexpdf    to make LaTeX and PDF files (default pdflatex)
      latexpdfja  to make LaTeX files and run them through platex/dvipdfmx
